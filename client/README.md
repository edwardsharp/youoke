# YOUOKE [client]

[youoke.party](http://youoke.party)

just a vcr-menu inspired react app, here. :shrug:

note: currently this app is configured to look for websocket servers on localhost:9001 (and maybe a few other selected IP addresses); maybe at some point there will be some kind of discovery system? see: `KNOWN_ROOMS` in Landing.tsx.

localhost dev: `npm start`

prod build: `npm run build`
